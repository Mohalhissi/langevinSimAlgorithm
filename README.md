# langevinSimAlgorithm
This is an algorithm to integrate the Langevin equation of motion in one dimension fro a particle in a double well potential and a thermal bath.
The results of this algorithm are explained in chapter 2 of my PhD thesis which can be accessed via http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-2-9qwqn93nuwco0
